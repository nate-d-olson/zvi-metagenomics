Does the ZVI lower microbial diversity
16S Alpha diversity analysis - compare the diversity between ZVI filtered and reclaimed water. 
Test for differences using appropriate paired two sample test (may need to account for temporal sampling)
Total abundance - if E. coli dominant, use E. coli MPN as abundance measurement
