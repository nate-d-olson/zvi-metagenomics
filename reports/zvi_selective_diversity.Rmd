# Objective 

# Approach  
Alpha diversity - evenness metric using shannon-better for 
Beta diversity analysis  - Using 16S is the overall community composition different between ZVI and reclaimed water - expectation is that if ZVI works in a specific manner that composition will be different, though differences in sequencing depth may bias the results. 
Test for differences using ANOSIM
